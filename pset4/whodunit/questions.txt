1.  stdint.h is a header file that defines data types with specific sizes/widths, and macro functions to allow creation of variables with these types.
2.  Benefits of using fixed with variables in a programs is that variable size doesn't depend on machine or different operating system implementation.
3.  BYTE is of type uint8_t, which has 8 bits or 1 byte.
    DWORD has type of uint32_t, which has 32 bits or 4 bytes.
    LONG is signed 32 bit integer, int32_t
    WORD is type uint16_t, which is unsigned 16 bit integer
4.  First two bytes in BMP file must be 0x42 and 0x4D, which stands for "BM" in ASCII. BM tells us that file follow Windows BMP specification.
5.  bfSize stores size of entire BMP file, and biSize stores only size of BMP image or only size of RGBTRIPLEs wihout headers
6.  If biHeight is negative that means the bitmap is top-down and origin is upper left corner.
7.  field biBitCount specifies number of bits that define each pixel and maximum number of colors in that bitmap.
8.  fopen will return NULL if specified file cannot be found.
9.  Third argument to fread is nmemb. It specifies number of things to read
10. Padding will be 3, because 3 pixels in in line * 3 bytes per pixel is equal to 9. 9 is not a multiple of 4, so scaline needs to be padded with zeroes to reach length that is multiple of 4, in this case 12.
11. Fseek changes current position of file pointer by a certain offset.
12. SEEK_CUR represents current location of pointer. It is used to offset cursor relative to current position.
